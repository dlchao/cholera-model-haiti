This C++ source code was used to simulate the cholera epidemic in
Haiti, which began in 2010. The work is described in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences ("Vaccination strategies for 
epidemic cholera in Haiti with implications for the developing 
world").

The code requires three data files: rivers.txt, highways.txt, and 
landscan_population_dms.txt.  The first two are derived from 
OpenStreetMap's data, which I downloaded from 
http://labs.geofabrik.de/haiti/2010-11-23-17-44.osm.bz2.
The last was derived from LandScan's data, which is not publicly
available. Therefore, we can not distribute the program with the 
data files required to run it.

The program requires the GNU Scientific library 
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) to compile.
